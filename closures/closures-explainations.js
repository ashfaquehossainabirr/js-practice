// Closure

// Definition:

// In programming, a closure is a combination of a function and its lexical environment. 
// The lexical environment consists of any variables that were in scope at the time the closure was created.

// To understand closures, it's important to first understand lexical scoping. 
// In JavaScript, variables declared within a function are only accessible within that function, 
// and any nested functions within it. However, a nested function can "remember" the variables from the 
// outer function even after the outer function has returned. This is because the inner function has access 
// to the variables in the outer function's lexical scope.


// Example:
function outer() {
    const name = "Bob";
  
    function inner() {
      console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    }
  
    return inner;
  }
  
  const greeting = outer();
  greeting(); // logs "Hello, Bob!"


// Explanation:

// In this example, outer defines a variable name and a function inner . inner is defined within outer, 
// so it has access to name in outer's lexical environment. When outer is called and returns inner, 
// a closure is created that retains access to name. This means that even though outer has finished 
// running and name is technically out of scope, inner can still access it and log a greeting with it.

// Another Example:
function counter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
}

const increment = counter();
increment(); // logs 1
increment(); // logs 2
increment(); // logs 3


// Explanation:

// In this example, counter returns a function that increments and logs a variable count each time it's called. 
// count is defined within counter, so it's not accessible outside of it. However, when counter returns the 
// inner function, a closure is created that retains access to count. This means that each time increment is 
// called, it can still access and modify count.
